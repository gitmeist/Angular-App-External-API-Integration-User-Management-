This project is a full Angular application that connects to an external REST API (https://peticiones.online/users) to perform complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on user data.

It features:

Dynamic routing and component-based architecture

Use of Bootstrap for responsive UI design

A home view with a user grid

Detail view for individual users

Form components for user creation and updates with validations

Alerts and feedback messages for actions like delete or submission

Modular code with Angular services and interfaces to handle HTTP requests

The API used is for educational purposes, so responses are mock data. This project demonstrates frontend interaction with a backend API using Angular best practices.








# MFPActividad03

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
